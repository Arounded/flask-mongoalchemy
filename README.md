#Flask MongoAlchemy

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) support for [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) using [MongoAlchemy](http://mongoalchemy.org).

For full documentation, see the online docs at: [soon]

##Why MongoAlchemy and not MongoEngine?

MongoAlchemy has a better API than MongoEngine, so I chose it. :)
